This is Catter, a social media platform, that's safe! This is much like Meower.

**WARNING:** Catter is not designed to be a competitor to Meower. It is a completely separate project.

**ANOTHER WARNING:** Catter is unstable and crashes very often! If you are annoyed with stuff crashing then Catter isn't for you!
